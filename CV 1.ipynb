    "1. What exactly is a feature?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, a feature refers to a measurable aspect or\n",
    "characteristic of a data point that can be used to make predictions or\n",
    "classifications. It can be a numerical value, categorical label, or any\n",
    "other form of data representation.\n",

    "A top edge detector convolutional kernel matrix is:\n",

    "\\[-1, -1, -1\\] \\[ 0, 0, 0\\] \\[ 1, 1, 1\\] This kernel is used to\n",
    "highlight the top edges in an image by subtracting the pixel values in\n",
    "the bottom row from those in the top row.\n",

    "**3. Describe the mathematical operation that a 3x3 kernel performs on a\n",
    "single pixel in an image.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A 3x3 kernel performs a convolution operation on a single pixel by\n",
    "multiplying the kernel values with the corresponding pixel values in its\n",
    "local neighborhood, summing the products, and then placing the result in\n",
    "the center pixel of a new output image. This process is repeated for\n",

    "**4. What is the significance of a convolutional kernel added to a 3x3\n",
    "matrix of zeroes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a convolutional kernel to a 3x3 matrix of zeroes creates a filter\n",
    "that only computes the convolution of the kernel with the image pixels\n",
    "and ignores the zeros. This is equivalent to applying a border of\n",
    "padding around the image before performing the convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What exactly is padding?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding refers to the process of adding additional pixels around the\n",
    "edges of an image before performing convolution. Padding can help\n",
    "preserve the spatial dimensions of the input image and prevent the\n",
    "output from shrinking too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What is the concept of stride?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stride refers to the number of pixels that the convolutional kernel\n",
    "moves horizontally and vertically at each step when performing\n",
    "convolution on an image. A larger stride results in a smaller output\n",

    "PyTorch's 2D convolution's input parameter has the shape (batch_size,\n",
    "num_input_channels, height, width), while the weight parameter has the\n",

    "\n",
    "In the context of deep learning, a channel refers to a set of feature\n",
    "maps that capture different aspects or representations of an image. A\n",
    "3-channel image, for example, has separate feature maps for the red,\n",
