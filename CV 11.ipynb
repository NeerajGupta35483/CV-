    "1. What do REGION PROPOSALS entail?**\n",
    "\n",
    "REGION PROPOSALS is a technique used in object detection to propose\n",
    "candidate object locations in an image. These proposals can be generated\n",
    "using various methods, such as selective search or edge boxes, and are\n",
    "used as input to object detection models for further refinement and\n",
    "classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What do you mean by NON-MAXIMUM SUPPRESSION? (NMS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "NON-MAXIMUM SUPPRESSION (NMS) is a post-processing step in object\n",
    "detection that filters out overlapping object detections by selecting\n",
    "only the highest scoring detection and suppressing others that have a\n",
    "high degree of overlap with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What exactly is mAP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "mAP stands for mean Average Precision, which is a metric used to\n",
    "evaluate the performance of object detection models. It takes into\n",
    "account both precision and recall, and calculates the average precision\n",
    "over a range of recall values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is a frames per secondÂ (FPS)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Frames per second (FPS) is a measure of how many frames an object\n",
    "detection model can process per second. It is an important metric for\n",
    "real-time applications, such as autonomous driving or video\n",
    "surveillance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What is an IOU (INTERSECTION OVER UNION)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "IOU (INTERSECTION OVER UNION) is a metric used to evaluate the overlap\n",
    "between two bounding boxes in object detection. It is defined as the\n",
    "ratio of the area of overlap between two bounding boxes to the area of\n",
    "their union.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Describe the PRECISION-RECALL CURVE (PR CURVE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "PRECISION-RECALL CURVE (PR CURVE) is a plot that shows the relationship\n",
    "between precision and recall for different detection thresholds in an\n",
    "object detection model. It is used to evaluate the performance of a\n",
    "model and compare it to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What is the term \"selective search\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Selective search\" is a popular region proposal algorithm used in object\n",
    "detection that combines multiple low-level image features to generate\n",
    "candidate object locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Describe the R-CNN model's four components.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-CNN model has four main components: (1) region proposal, which\n",
    "generates candidate object locations, (2) feature extraction, which\n",
    "extracts features from each candidate region, (3) object classification,\n",
    "which uses the extracted features to classify each region as an object\n",
    "or background, and (4) object localization, which refines the bounding\n",
    "box coordinates of each detected object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What exactly is the Localization Module?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Localization Module is a component of the R-CNN model that refines\n",
    "the bounding box coordinates of each detected object by predicting\n",
    "offsets from the original bounding box coordinates generated by the\n",
    "region proposal algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What are the R-CNN DISADVANTAGES?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some disadvantages of the R-CNN model include its high computational and\n",
    "memory requirements, as well as its slow processing speed. Additionally,\n",
    "it requires training separate models for object detection and object\n",
    "classification, which can be time-consuming and computationally\n",
    "expensive."
